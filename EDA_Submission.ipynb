        "The choice of using pie charts in this context was made to visually represent the proportion of churned and not churned customers across different combinations of area codes and international plans. Pie charts are effective for showing parts of a whole, making it easy to compare the distribution of churn statuses within each category. However, when comparing multiple categories, it's important to consider potential limitations in conveying precise comparisons due to the circular nature of pie charts"

        "The insights from the chart reveal that in cases of \"True\" churn, the area code 415 has a higher proportion of \"Yes\" for voice mail plans (7.0%) compared to the other area codes. Additionally, the relatively lower proportion of \"No\" international plans in area code 415 (41.8%)  suggest that Voice mail plans could be a contributing factor to churn in that area. In contrast, for \"False\" churn, area code 415 has a higher proportion of \"No\" voice mail plans (34.5%), indicating that customers without international plans are less likely to churn in that area. This suggests that area code 415 could benefit from targeted strategies to address churn based on voice mail plan preferences."

        "**International Plan Impact:** Customers with an international plan seem to have a notable impact on churn. It's essential for the client to focus on understanding the reasons behind this trend. Initiating targeted outreach to customers with international plans and addressing their specific needs could help in retention efforts.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Customer Service Calls**: The frequency of customer service calls plays a role in churn. The analysis reveals that those who churn have a tendency to make more customer service calls. The client can use this insight to identify the reasons behind such calls and proactively address issues to reduce churn risk.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Area Code Insights:** The relationship between area codes, international plans, and churn is noteworthy. Targeted strategies can be implemented for specific area codes where churn is prevalent. This might include optimizing international plan offerings, customer support, or addressing unique regional challenges.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Engagement Metrics:** Observing engagement metrics like the number of voice mail messages and total minutes of usage during different times of the day can provide insights into customer satisfaction and loyalty. The client should focus on maintaining high engagement levels through effective communication and service.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Non-Churn Patterns:** Understanding the behaviors and attributes of non-churned customers is equally important. The client can leverage these insights to identify and reward loyal customers, potentially inspiring retention and advocacy efforts.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Customer Segmentation:** Segmenting customers based on their usage patterns, service preferences, and demographics can lead to targeted retention strategies. By tailoring offerings to specific customer segments, the client can enhance customer satisfaction and loyalty.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Pricing Strategies:** The analysis of charges and their impact on churn can guide the client in optimizing their pricing strategies. Ensuring that charges align with perceived value can help in reducing price-related churn.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Communication Strategy:** Effective communication can play a pivotal role in customer retention. The client can use the insights gained from the analysis to craft personalized communication strategies that address customer needs, provide value, and maintain positive relationships.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Continuous Monitoring:** Churn analysis is an ongoing process. The client should establish a system to continuously monitor churn metrics and customer behavior. This will allow them to adapt strategies based on evolving trends and maintain a proactive approach to customer retention."
